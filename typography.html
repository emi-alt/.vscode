        <h1>Tissues <small class="text-body-secondary">Plant and Animal tissues</small></h1>
        <p>A group of cells that are similar in structure and/or work together to achieve a particular fuunction forma a tissue</p> 
        <p>It is of two types - Plant tissue and Animal tissue</p> <br>

        <h1 class="display-6">1. Plant tissues</h1> <br>
        <h4>Types of plant tissues</h4>
        
        <ol>
           <li>1.a Meristematic tissue</li>
           <li>1.b Permanent tissue</li>    
        </ol>

        <h4> <u>Types of Meristematic tissues</u></h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1.a.1 Apical</li>
            <li>1.a.2 Intercalary</li>
            <li>1.a.3 Lateral</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>1.a.1 Apical meristem</h3>
         <p>Apical meristem is present at the growing roots and increases the <mark>length</mark> of the root. </p>

        <h3>1.a.2 Intercalary meristem</h3>
         <p>Intercalary meristem seen in some plants is located near the <mark>node</mark> <p><ins>(from where the flowers and leaves grow)</ins></p></p>

        <h3>1.a.3 Lateral</h3>
         <p>The <mark>girth</mark> of the stem or root increases due to lateral meristem.</p>

        <h4> <u>Types of Permanent tissues</u></h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1.b.1 Simple permanent tissue</li>
            <li>1.b.2 Complex permanent tissue</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>1.b.1 Simple permanent tissue</h3>
         <p>Simple permanent tissues are characterized by having cells that are structurally and functionally similar, meaning they are made up of only one type of cell. </p> 
         <p>They are also known as homogeneous tissues. </p>

        <h3>1.b.2 Complex permanent tissue</h3>
         <p>Complex permanent tissue is a group of cells that perform a common function and are made up of different types of cells. These tissues are found in plants and are also known as vascular tissues. </p>
